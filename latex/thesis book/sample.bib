It has been obtained by fitting more than 38 thousand ab initio energies computed using the aug-cc-pVTZ and aug-cc-pVQZ basis sets and extrapolated to the basis set limit. The functional form used to represent the four-body short-range interactions is based on a sum of polynomial functions of the fourth degree multiplied by a range factor{,} both built with intrinsic permutation symmetry and centred at specific reference geometries{,} to which the ab initio points computed are assigned based on a k-means algorithm.

@article{idx150,
	abstract = {A general program to fit global adiabatic potential energy surfaces of up to tetratomic molecules to ab initio points and available spectroscopic data for simple diatomics is reported. It is based on the Combined-Hyperbolic-Inverse-Power-Representation (CHIPR) method. The final form describes all dissociating fragments and long-range/valence interactions, while obeying the system permutational symmetry. The code yields as output a Fortran 90 subroutine that readily evaluates the potential and gradient at any arbitrary geometry.
    Program summary
    Program title: CHIPR-4.0 CPC Library link to program files: http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/8wdv87gt5x.2 Licensing provisions: GPLv3 Programming language: Fortran 90 Journal reference of previous version: C. M. R. Rocha, A. J. C. Varandas, Comput. Phys. Commun. 247 (2020) 106913 Does the new version supersede the previous version?: Yes Reasons for the new version: CHIPR-4.0 is a major extension of the previous CHIPR-3.0 code [1] which, besides diatomics and triatomics, also includes the possibility of fitting global adiabatic potential energy surfaces (PESs) of A4-, AB3-, A2B2-, ABC2- and ABCD-type tetratomic molecules [3]. Additionally, a new feature is that it allows the user to fine-tune ab initio diatomic curves using available spectroscopic data. Summary of revisions: • Implementation of CHIPR’s polynomial form and permutation operators for tetratomic molecules • Implementation of a direct-fit module to fine-tune ab initio potential energy curves using spectroscopic data • Automatic global minimum search on the diatomic, triatomic or tetratomic final PESs • Automatic harmonic vibrational analysis at the optimum molecular geometries Nature of problem: This version of the CHIPR code, CHIPR-4.0, provides a set of subroutines to fit global adiabatic potential energy surfaces of up to tetratomic molecules using ab initio and (for diatomics) optional fine-tuning experimental data. Solution method: CHIPR-4.0 uses the Combined-Hyperbolic-Inverse-Power-Representation (CHIPR) [2] method to interpolate and extrapolate ab initio data points. Additional comments including restrictions and unusual features: For triatomic and tetratomic fits, the user must supply subroutines containing the analytic forms defining the sum of two- and two-plus-three-bodies, respectively. These are utilized internally to calculate (from ab initio data) the corresponding three- and four-body energies to be fitted. The current version of this code is strictly based on single-sheeted analytical PESs. High-accuracy in diatomic refinements is currently limited to the 1Σ single-curve case. References [1] C. M. R.

These potential functions are important in the accurate determination of O-H and O-D collision cross sections. The isotope effect in the O-H and O-D cross sections plays an important role in the enhanced nonthermal escape of H and D from Mars and Venus. The quantum mechanical elastic scattering cross sections for O-H and O-D collisions are determined with a set of potentials which are constructed with a new interpolation of the short range tabulated potentials and the long range asymptotic behaviour. The important role of the asymptotic radial variation of the potential functions in the determination of the elastic cross sections is studied in detail with a semiclassical analysis, and a comparison is made with previous calculations. The vibrational energies for several different X(2)Pi bound potential functions for OH are also calculated and compared with published results. (C) 1999 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

    abstract = {A potential energy surface is reported at the complete basis set limit for the ground electronic state of HO2+ via a four dimensional interpolation in relaxed hyperspherical coordinates. The dissociated products OH+ and O2+ have also been studied at the complete basis set level and subsequently analytically modelled. In the case of O2+, the vibrational states predicted from the model potential have also been directly included in the fit. The potential form so obtained matches the RKR levels with a root mean square deviation below 1cm-1. Spin orbit + relativistic effects have also been taken into account for the O2+ ion.

     abstract = {The largest treatise in Roshdi Rashed's edition of the mathematical works of Sharaf al-Dīn al-Ṭūsī is Al-muʿādalāt, a work devoted to the solution of cubic equations. This treatise shows that Islamic authors went considerably beyond the achievements of ʿUmar al-Khayyāmī in three areas: (1) finding conditions for the existence of solutions to cubic equations, (2) discovering algorithms for calculating these solutions, and (3) justifying these algorithms. Although so much is clear, it is still no easy task to understand Sharaf al-Dīn's thought processes and so achieve an understanding of the historical filiations of the document. Rashed has argued that Sharaf al-Dīn discovered the derivative of cubic polynomials and realized its significance for investigating conditions under which cubic equations were solvable; however, other scholars have suggested quite different explanations of Sharaf al-Dīn's thinking, which connect it with mathematics found in Euclid or Archimedes. Our purpose in the present essay review is to decide which of these three readings seems best to fit the text.},
